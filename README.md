Sentiment-Analysis-of-Company-Reviews-

This is a Kaggle Competition and we used different Deep Learning Models to do the task of Sentiment Analysis of Company Reviews. We also compared the performances of the different DL Models . 

Problem Statement :<br>

Through this project, we as a team will be participating in an ongoing Kaggle Competition. The goal is to perform Sentiment Analysis on Company Reviews given by customers. The target is to predict the number of stars in star rating from 1 to 5.  The specification given by the host of competition is the use of a regression metric, namely Mean Absolute Error (MAE), to evaluate predictions. 

Dataset Details :

The data set consists of 100,000 reviews of 40 different companies collected from Trustpilot. The samples are split by the host according to 60% train, 10% public leaderboard, and 30% private leaderboard. This will bring us to the training data of 60,000 points and test data of 10,000 points. Data consist of columns as ‘id’, ‘Review’, and ‘Rating’. 

Little review around problem statement :

To complete this task, we will use different deep learning models such as RNN, LSTM, GRU, Bi-LSTM, etc., along with different Embedding Techniques for each. These Methods were obtained from the paper Deep Learning Based Techniques for Sentiment Analysis: A Survey. We will also try to take it further using transformers and different LSTM variants. During the duration of this project, if we find a better model, we will try to implement it too.  If time permits, we can also try experimenting with this dataset for further analysis and betterment.
